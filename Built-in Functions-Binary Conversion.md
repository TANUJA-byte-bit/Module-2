# 2a) Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **25** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## Algorithm
1. Assign the value `25` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## Program
```
decimal_number = int(input())
binary_number = bin(decimal_number)
print(binary_number)
```

## Output
